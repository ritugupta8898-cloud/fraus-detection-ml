# 🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection — Machine Learning Project

This project builds a complete Machine Learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset. It includes data preprocessing, oversampling, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is rare (0.17% cases), making this an **imbalanced classification** problem.  
Because of this, **accuracy alone is meaningless**, so the project focuses on:

- **Recall** (ability to catch fraud)
- **Precision** (avoiding false alarms)
- **ROC-AUC** (overall discrimination ability)

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Load and preprocess dataset  
- Scale `Time` and `Amount`  
- Handle imbalance using RandomOverSampler  
- Train Random Forest classifier  
- Train Linear SVM (for fast & efficient fraud detection)
- Evaluate with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
- Clean, industry-standard project structure

### 🔥 Model Comparison Summary

Fraud detection prioritizes **catching more fraud cases (higher Recall)** because missing a fraud is more costly than a false alert.

| Model | Strength | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Random Forest** | Detects more fraud cases | Higher Recall + AUC → catches more fraudulent transactions |
| **Linear SVM** | Gives fewer false alarms | Higher Precision + F1-score → predictions are more reliable |

---

### 🏁 Final Conclusion

**Random Forest is more suitable for fraud detection** in this dataset  
because it identifies more fraudulent transactions overall.

**Linear SVM is still useful** as a lighter model with fewer false positives.
